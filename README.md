<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Repository

This repository holds the python implementation files for Assignment #2 for E1 213 Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks offered at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. In this assignment we will explore linear models and compare different methods of learning linear classifiers and regression functions. The following methods have been implemented across the problems.

* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* One vs Rest classification
* One hot classification

Problem 1 deals with implementing and evaluating linear and logistic regressions with synthetic data drawn from Gamma, Uniform and Normal distributions.
Problem 2 deals with classification using the Iris dataset with three 2-class classifiers using ‘one vs rest’ strategy and with a 3-class linear classifier (by taking the target variable as a 3-dimensional one-hot vector). 
Problems 3 deals with classification using German credit data using linear least squares and logistic regression.
Problem 4 deals with an 1D regression with polynomial fitting.
